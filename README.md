This project was created using Xcode 16 beta. I recently upgraded my mac to the MacOS sequoia so only xcode 16 is supported.
However, the project is targeted to support iOS 17.0 and up.

How to run the project:
1. Download the project or clone the repo
2. Go to the project folder and open FetchRecipe.xcodeproj
3. Select your simulator and click the Run button
4. Once the simulator launches you may have to wait a couple seconds for the recipes to download.
